# BootcampWk7 Full Stack Node.js Note Taker  
 
This project is my first full stack application built from the ground up using Node.js. It’s a lightweight task management system that supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via a custom-built backend API. Tasks are stored locally in a JSON file, with server-side handling powered entirely by Node.js and Express.

While I have worked with APIs before, this was my first time building one myself — and it has been a valuable learning experience. Designing a working backend helped me understand how routes, data handling, and persistence all come together behind the scenes.

✨ Key Features
	•	Custom-built CRUD API using Node.js
	•	Local file storage for task data
	•	Timestamp fields for creation and last edit
	•	Basic Bootstrap styling for a clean, responsive interface
	•	Frontend feedback via user notifications (e.g., on save, delete, or error)
	•	Input validation and helpful error handling

This project went a little beyond the original brief — I wanted to challenge myself and explore additional functionality. While it’s still a work in progress, it has helped me solidify core concepts and given me a strong foundation for future full stack work.# Installation Instructions
